I'm looking for either of two things:

   - An internet newsfeed (ANY feed, stable or not) local to central Iowa,
     around Ames/Des Moines preferably.

   - A job located somewhere in Iowa, again, preferably near Des Moines.  I
     know, I know--"Iowa???"  That's what everyone says.  But my SO is starting
     school at Grinnell this fall, and I wanna be around for it.

     Microsoft's being nice to me, but my internship will be over around
     January of 1993; and 'cause of regulations, they can't hire an intern
     again until X months after the last internship ended.  So I've gotta find
     somebody else instead...

     If your company is in need of a very experienced Unix/MSDOS/VMS
     C/C++/Pascal/FORTRAN/680x0/80x86/6502 programmer, let me know and I'll
     float you a resume.  I'm unsure of my internet connection for a while, so
     contact me through:
           Richard P Jernigan IV
           PO Box 827
           Norris, TN  37828
             615-494-0445
     Okay.  So what are the odds I'll get a response to that?  :)

PostScript:  I actually DID get a response!  Didn't take 'em up 'cause
             I'm doin that summer thang at Microsoft.  But as I said, that's
             almost over.
